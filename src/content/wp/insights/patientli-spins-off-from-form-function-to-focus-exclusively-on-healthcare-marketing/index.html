<p><strong>Patientli, a specialized healthcare marketing company, today announced its spin-off from Form + Function to become an independent company focused exclusively on serving dental and healthcare practices across the United States.</strong></p>
<p>The spin-off represents a strategic decision to dedicate full resources to addressing the unique marketing and branding challenges facing healthcare practices, particularly the lack of professional, consistent brand identity that has long plagued the industry.</p>
<h2>From General Agency to Healthcare Specialist</h2>
<p>Form + Function Agency, a full-service digital marketing and design agency founded in 2013, had been serving healthcare clients as part of its broader portfolio for over a decade. However, as demand for specialized healthcare marketing services grew, founder Justin Bosco recognized the opportunity to create a dedicated platform specifically designed for the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthcare practices have fundamentally different marketing needs than other businesses,&#8221; said Bosco, who brings extensive experience from designing systems for some of the world&#8217;s largest tech companies. &#8220;They need professional branding that builds trust with patients, integrated marketing that works across multiple touchpoints, and transparent pricing that makes sense for independent practices. The general marketing agency model wasn&#8217;t allowing us to fully serve these unique requirements.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a href="/looks"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8846 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Looks-CTA-Large.webp" alt="" width="850" height="530" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Looks-CTA-Large.webp 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Looks-CTA-Large-300x187.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Looks-CTA-Large-768x479.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Looks-CTA-Large-600x374.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></h2>
<h2>Introducing &#8220;Looks&#8221; &#8211; A Revolutionary Approach to Healthcare Branding</h2>
<p>Central to Patientli&#8217;s launch is the introduction of <a href="/looks">&#8220;Looks&#8221; &#8211; a proprietary system of modular brand kits that brings enterprise-level design consistency to healthcare practices at an accessible price point.</a></p>
<p>The Looks system addresses a critical industry problem: most dental practices receive their &#8220;brand identity&#8221; as a byproduct of working with website companies that provide basic logos and templates, resulting in inconsistent, unprofessional brand presentation that looks more like it came from a cheap stock photo site than the brand of a their more modern and sophisticated competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I worked in tech, we used sophisticated design systems and component libraries to ensure brand consistency as companies scaled,&#8221; Bosco explained. &#8220;These systems are totally foreign to small healthcare businesses, but the needs that they solve aren&#8217;t. Healthcare practices deserve the same level of professional branding that patients see from companies like Tend and Dentologie in dental, or One Medical in primary care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge, Bosco noted, is that large organizations like these have million-dollar budgets for websites, branding, and marketing—resources that independent practices simply don&#8217;t have access to. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t think this was fair, especially when independently-owned practices often have better care outcomes than these heavily-funded competitors. Our goal was to provide practices of all sizes the quality of design, brand, and marketing that used to be reserved only for the biggest and most innovative players in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traditional custom branding process costs tens of thousands of dollars and takes months to complete. &#8220;Looks gives them enterprise-quality brand identity in weeks, not months, and at a fraction of the cost,&#8221; Bosco said. &#8220;Now even a startup practice with a shoestring budget can instantly have a brand presence that rivals the largest, deep-pocketed competitors in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each Patientli Look includes the following fully-customizable assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design or update</li>
<li>Complete color palette and typography system, which can be used exactly as seen on www.patient.li/looks or customized to make it more unique to your practice</li>
<li>A fully-designed and managed website</li>
<li>Marketing materials for common physical materials like signage, patient giveaways, print advertising, stationery, flyers, and more</li>
<li>Designs for common digital matierlas Brand guidelines and usage standards</li>
<li>Digital asset libraries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comprehensive Marketing Platform</h2>
<p>Beyond branding, Patientli offers a complete marketing platform designed specifically for healthcare practices. Their plans are designed to scale up as you grow your practice and your goals evolve. Plans can include:</p>
<p><strong>Brand Design &amp; Identity Systems</strong> Professional brand development using the proprietary Looks system</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Website Design</strong> Fast, effective websites optimized for patient conversion and search engines</p>
<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> Local SEO strategies designed for healthcare practice visibility</p>
<p><strong>Digital Advertising Management</strong> Targeted advertising campaigns for patient acquisition</p>
<p><strong>Review &amp; Reputation Management</strong> Comprehensive online reputation monitoring and enhancement</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Management</strong> Healthcare-compliant social media strategies and content</p>
<h2>Addressing Industry Pain Points</h2>
<p>The healthcare marketing industry has long been dominated by agencies that focus on single services (SEO-only, website-only, or advertising-only) or provide generic solutions not tailored to healthcare patient behavior.</p>
<p>Patientli&#8217;s integrated approach addresses several key industry challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand Inconsistency</strong>: Most practices lack cohesive brand identity across touchpoints</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Coordination</strong>: Practices often work with multiple vendors for different marketing needs</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Compliance</strong>: Generic marketing agencies often lack healthcare industry knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Transparency</strong>: Many agencies use complex pricing structures or hidden fees</li>
<li><strong>Patient Journey Understanding</strong>: Few agencies optimize for the complete patient decision-making process</li>
</ul>
<h2>Service Tiers and Accessibility</h2>
<p>Patientli operates on a subscription model with three main tiers designed to grow with practices:</p>
<p><strong>Basic Plan</strong> &#8211; Essential branding and website foundation<br />
<strong>Starter Plan</strong> &#8211; Comprehensive marketing including SEO and reputation management<br />
<strong>Growth Plan</strong> &#8211; Full-service marketing with advertising and content marketing</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to make professional marketing accessible to every type of healthcare practice,&#8221; Bosco noted. &#8220;Whether you&#8217;re a solo practitioner just starting out or a multi-location group, our system scales with your needs and budget.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Early Results and Client Response</h2>
<p>Since the informal launch of Patientli services in late 2024, early clients have reported significant improvements in patient acquisition and brand recognition. Fort Washington Dental Associates, for example, increased new patient acquisition from 15 to over 40 patients per month following implementation of Patientli&#8217;s comprehensive branding and marketing system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference was immediate,&#8221; reported a practice administrator from an early client practice. &#8220;Patients started commenting on how professional our marketing looked, and we could see the improvement in our online presence almost right away.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Patientli plans to expand services throughout the English-speaking world following the integration of multi-currency payment systems. The company is also developing additional specialized solutions for dental specialties and multi-location healthcare groups.</p>
<p>The spin-off positions Patientli to capture growing demand for specialized healthcare marketing services as practices increasingly recognize the importance of professional brand identity and integrated marketing strategies in competitive healthcare markets.</p>
<h2>About Patientli</h2>
<p>Patientli is a healthcare marketing company that helps dental and healthcare practices attract more patients through modern branding, comprehensive marketing strategies, and patient experience design. Founded in 2024 as a spin-off from Form + Function, Patientli specializes in making enterprise-level marketing quality accessible to independent healthcare practices through its proprietary &#8220;Looks&#8221; brand system and transparent pricing model.</p>
