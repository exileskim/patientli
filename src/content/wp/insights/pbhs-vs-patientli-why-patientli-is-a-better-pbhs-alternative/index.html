<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Patientli and PBHS RevenueWell provide website design and digital marketing services for healthcare practices, but they take fundamentally different approaches to service delivery and pricing structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell operates as part of a larger practice management software company, offering template-based websites alongside RevenueWell&#8217;s patient communication tools. Patientli focuses exclusively on healthcare marketing, providing custom website design with integrated branding as part of a comprehensive marketing system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comparison examines their services, pricing, and implementation approaches to help practices evaluate which solution better fits their needs and resources.</span></p>

<h2>Is Patientli a good PBHS alternative?</h2>
<h3>PBHS vs Patientli: Website Design</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9884" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9884" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9884" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1029" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px-300x193.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px-1024x659.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px-768x494.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px-1536x988.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Website-Template-Gallery-1600px-600x386.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9884" class="wp-caption-text">PBHS allows clients to choose from a gallery of website templates. However, the templates don&#8217;t always align with modern web design styles.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell offers clients two different website approaches: a custom website solution with a $6,000 setup fee and more cost effective semi-custom templates, which are priced at $169/month. Their sales representatives actively promote their semi-custom sites as their standard offering. </span><a href="https://www.dentalfreeway.com/design-choices/general-dentistry-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These templates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be lightly customized by the PBHS team during the onboarding process. Afterwards, clients are provided with login credentials and instructions to handle most design updates and maintenance themselves through DIY editing tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their sales team explains that the website design process typically involves matching website colors to existing practice logos, which assumes practices already have professional branding. Practices who don’t or aren’t thrilled with their existing brand styles may be disappointed with the results as logo colors aren&#8217;t always suitable for website applications &#8211; they may lack proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance or fail to work harmoniously across different web applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client gets tired of their semi-custom website’s aesthetic, PBHS allows them to switch to different templates within their fairly extensive library of templates. For custom sites, a redesign would incur another $6,000 setup fee.</span></p>
<p><b>The verdict:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PBHS semi-custom websites provide a decent, lower-cost option for practices who place a lower priority on design quality and uniqueness and who have the bandwidth and expertise to handle some parts of their setup and updates on their own. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9888" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9888" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble-300x225.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble-1024x768.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble-768x576.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble-1536x1152.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Enamel-Website-Mockup-3_2-for-Dribbble-600x450.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9888" class="wp-caption-text">Patientli&#8217;s website system is regularly maintained and updated, making for more modern and conversion-optimized designs that impress patients and get more bookings.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Patientli has a single pricing plan for websites that forms the foundation for its website-only Basic plan ($750/mo) and gives clients full access to the </span><a href="/service/healthcare-website-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli website system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their website system differentiates on high-quality design and was built by designers that have worked for top agencies and technology companies. While their sites use a system of modules, reusable building blocks for commonly used sections like patient reviews, doctor bios, and more, their design system allows for infinite combinations of website sections, styles and more to achieve custom, high-quality designs quickly – delivered in as few as 2 weeks compared to PBHS 6 week to 6 month timelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a design perspective, Patientli’s website quality far exceeds PBHS’ offerings. Rather than adapting websites to existing logos, </span><a href="/service/brand-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we design complete visual systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that work cohesively across all applications &#8211; from websites to business cards to social media, so you get more than a custom website. This integrated approach ensures your practice appears professionally everywhere patients might encounter it, with modern, polished designs, proper color contrast for accessibility and visual harmony across all patient touchpoints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to PBHS’ two website offerings, Patientli sites are more comparable in nature and quality to PBHS custom designs, though that isn’t even a fair comparison. Here are a few differences: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli sites are designed and updated for you by their team with free unlimited updates, so you’ll never be stuck trying to figure out how to update your site when a new team member is added or a new service becomes offered. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="/service/healthcare-website-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli’s websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are built on a framework that the company is constantly updating to stay up to date with the latest guidelines and trends around web accessibility, design, SEO and even AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Their sites are designed to be the last website you’ll ever need to buy, breaking the web design cycle that mandates an expensive redesign every 2-3 years to keep up with changing technical standards and marketing demands.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their Basic plan provides much more than a website. In fact, websites are just one part of </span><a href="/looks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their innovative Looks product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a brand solution that allows healthcare practices to access a growing number of top agency-designed brand styles that includes things like business cards, stationery, signage, patient giveaways and more– basically everything a modern practice needs to look polished and professional, standing out from the crowd to impress today’s discerning patients. Plus, Patientli allows their clients to restyle their website every two years by switching to a new Look, keeping them at the forefront of changing design trends– perfect for practices who want to come across as cutting edge or high-end. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, Patientli is a marketing company, so its websites are built to serve as a strong foundation for powerful digital marketing strategies, which are available in its </span><a href="/pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher-tiered plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The verdict:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If great design and marketing integration matters to you, and if you’re willing to meet a budget closer to a PBHS custom site in exchange for a full-service option, Patientli is worth considering. The key difference comes down to design quality and service delivery: PBHS RevenueWell provides tools and templates for practices to manage themselves, while Patientli handles all design work, updates, and maintenance professionally.</span></p>

<h3>PBHS vs Patientli: Brand Design</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9886" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9886" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9886" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="995" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding-300x187.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding-1024x637.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding-768x478.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding-1536x955.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PBHS-Branding-600x373.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9886" class="wp-caption-text">PBHS does offer a branding service focused on creating clip art style logos and materials.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell offers branding as a separate service with additional costs that’s not included in their website design packages. Their standard website design approach assumes practices already have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suitable branding to work with. PBHS has a </span><a href="https://www.pbhs.com/practice-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand design page on their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it doesn’t include many details about what the branding service offers. On a separate area of their website they offer a <a href="https://shop.pbhs.com/products/pre-designed-logo-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-designed logo for $495</a> and <a href="https://shop.pbhs.com/collections/branding/products/logo-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a custom logo for $1,250</a>. both of these options appear to include only a logo, not additional branded materials the practice might need like stationery, social media profile graphics, patient giveaways and more. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5489" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5489" style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5489 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento-600x450.webp 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento-300x225.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento-1024x768.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento-768x576.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lumena-Brand-Bento-1536x1152.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5489" class="wp-caption-text">Patientli can create or refresh your office&#8217;s brand to meet modern standards and impress more patients. All of Patientli&#8217;s plans include multiple types of branded materials to let your brand shine everywhere patients might encounter it.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="/service/brand-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand design is core to Patientli’s offering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is included in every tier of their service. Their brand design work is considered higher quality than that offered by PBHS. Their </span><a href="/looks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows independent practices to access the same design quality as well-funded and fast-growing companies in the industry like Tend and Dentologie. Customers report liking that the Looks system allows them to get a new brand or refresh an existing one without the uncertainty or cost of starting from scratch. Patientli’s website mentions several branded materials included with their Basic package: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logo design or refresh</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionally selected colors and fonts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full website</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business cards, stationery and print materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Business profile assets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient giveaways</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The verdict:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PBHS’ branding services are offered as an afterthought to its websites and don’t seem to be where the company excels. Patientli’s brand design services lead the industry. Their branding services are deeply integrated into all of their packages, allowing practices to put their best foot forward to stand out from the crowd and attract the best patients. </span></p>
<h3>PBHS vs Patientli: SEO and Marketing Strategies</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell&#8217;s strength lies in software &#8211; patient communications, appointment reminders, and automated workflows. Their marketing approach seems to extend this approach, leading with tools and software that enable practices to more efficiently take on the work of managing parts of their own marketing to keep costs down. Of the 10 services listed in the marketing menu of their website, four (website design, TruForm Patient Forms, Appointment Reminders, Reputation Management) are self-led by the practice, with only tools provided by PBHS, not full-service labor. The remaining full-service offerings (SEO, Social Media Management, PPC Management, Video Marketing and Branding) are slim on details about what specifically they include.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli&#8217;s marketing packages are full-service, designed to minimize the burden on practice owners and team members. Their strategies are also designed according to a published, research-backed approach that maps marketing activities and website content to different stages of the patient journey. Patientli’s approach also addresses current search realities, including AI search optimization for engines like ChatGPT and Claude. Patientli publishes their pricing on their website and has detailed website pages about each of the services it offers. Its plans are designed to allow practices to scale up </span></p>
<p><b>The verdict:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The difference shows in methodology and transparency. PBHS RevenueWell keeps their tactics proprietary and their pricing private, while Patientli publishes our research-based strategies openly, allowing practices to understand exactly how we drive results and how to budget for our services.</span></p>
<h3>PBHS vs Patientli: Pricing and Payment Structures</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell doesn’t publish its pricing– it uses contact-based pricing across most services. Their sales process requires consultations to receive quotes, and pricing can vary significantly based on practice size, location, and services selected. The PBHS pricing information sourced in this article came from reviews and research, so if you’re seriously considering PBHS, we encourage you to contact them for the most accurate pricing.</span></p>
<p><a href="/pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli publishes all pricing transparently on our website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Practices know exactly what they&#8217;ll pay monthly with no hidden setup fees, long-term contracts, or surprise add-ons. This transparency allows practice owners to budget accurately and compare options without sales pressure.</span></p>
<h3>PBHS vs Patientli: Implementation Speed and Timeline</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell&#8217;s custom website development reportedly takes 40+ hours of work and can require anywhere from 45 days to 6 months for completion. Much of this timeline depends on client responsiveness, but the extended process can delay practice launches or rebranding efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patientli delivers complete brand systems and websites within 14 days. This speed advantage helps practices launch faster or implement rebranding without extended waiting periods that can impact patient acquisition.</span></p>
<h2>What PBHS RevenueWell Offers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protective Business and Health Systems (PBHS) has been around for a long time– founded in the 1970s as an accounting and payroll system and later adding web design to its offerings. PBHS was strategically acquired by RevenueWell in 2021 to create a unified platform that combines website services with practice management software. Recently, customers have complained that buying a website through PBHS opens the door to sales reps pushing other Revenuewell products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, client satisfaction appears mixed. Their Yelp reviews average 1.9 out of 5 stars, and they currently hold an F rating with the Better Business Bureau. Employee reviews on Glassdoor average 3.6 out of 5 stars, with feedback citing customer satisfaction challenges and high employee turnover. Employee reviews mention that &#8220;the company is desperate to stay competitive but sacrifices customer satisfaction and isn&#8217;t receptive to employee burnout.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their software platform strength lies in practice management automation &#8211; appointment reminders, patient communications, and workflow optimization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell operates as a large-scale service provider with established systems and processes. This scale provides consistency and comprehensive feature sets, though it may limit personalized attention compared to smaller, more focused companies. </span></p>
<h2>Making Your Choice</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose Patientli if you want your practice to compete on brand quality and visual sophistication with full-service support. Our integrated systems help independent practices achieve marketing presence that rivals large corporate competitors without enterprise-level costs. The transparent pricing, modern SEO strategies, and custom content approach works well for practices that want professional marketing management rather than DIY tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach makes sense for practices prioritizing brand differentiation, fast implementation, and comprehensive service where our team handles all marketing tasks professionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose PBHS RevenueWell if you&#8217;re already using RevenueWell practice management software and want integrated tools, or if you prefer lower-cost template solutions and don&#8217;t mind handling significant design and maintenance work yourself. Their software-pipeline approach provides good value for practices comfortable with self-service tools and DIY website management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBHS RevenueWell works well for existing RevenueWell software users who want seamless integration, or budget-conscious practices willing to take on website editing and maintenance responsibilities in exchange for lower monthly costs.</span></p>
