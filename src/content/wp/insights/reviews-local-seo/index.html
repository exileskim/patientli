With the importance of online reviews to consumers, it’s not shocking that they’ve been incorporated as a ranking factor in local SEO.

Certain online review sites are more important than others and each has different rules about what kind of reviews it accepts.

To help, we’ll provide a quick explanation of how reviews impact local SEO and touch on how to go about getting reviews on some of the most important reviews sites without running afoul of their rules. </p>								</div>

									<p>When it comes to reviews sites for local SEO, not all are created equal. Far and away, the most important place to collect reviews is on your Google My Business page, a profile that appears within local search results and displays Google reviews, as well as an aggregation of reviews from other sites around the web. Google reviews are great because they appear as a star rating on Google Business profiles, which are known to increase click-through. While reviews from other sites, like Yelp or Facebook, require a searcher to look for a business on that particular site, everyone uses Google, making Google reviews the most visible and most important type of reviews for local SEO.</p><p>In terms of local SEO, other sites matter beyond Google as well. Yelp is a fantastic place to collect reviews, as is Facebook. Industry-specific sites matter too. Having reviews on HealthGrades might help a medical practitioner, whereas sites like Avvo matter for lawyers.</p><p>When asking customers for reviews, it’s important for businesses to prioritize which sites send to a customer to avoid overwhelming them and increase the likelihood that their valuable review will end up on an important major review site. </p>								</div>

									<p>How you go about getting reviews from customers is important. It’s never a good idea to badger customers for reviews, and depending on the website you’d like them to review you on, even asking for a review could violate policy and result in the review being taken down. However, there are a few best practices that apply to gaining reviews, and following them can help make your review-gathering efforts much more fruitful.</p><p>Make it easy to leave a review: Even if you’re a pro at leaving reviews on any number or sites, it’s important to recognize that your best customers and promoters may have never left a review for a business before in their lives. Customers don’t want to jump through hoops to review you. Providing them with a link to get directly to you Google Business page can be a really helpful way to lead a horse to water. Search your business name on Google and click on the “Write a Review” button that displays on your profile. Next, copy the URL from your browser window. Send this URL to customers in email communication to ask them to share their experience with your business and to avoid any confusion on how to leave a review for you.</p>								</div>

									<p>When it comes to Google reviews, the do’s and don’ts are pretty fair. Google allows local businesses to explicitly ask customers to review them on Google, so don’t be shy about telling customers that you’d appreciate their review on Google. Here are a few extra tips on how to stay on Google’s good side when looking for reviews:</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t incentivize reviewers:</strong> Google’s policy is that reviewers shouldn’t be compensated in exchange for a positive review, so while asking for a review is fine, asking for a review in exchange for a free product or service is not.</li><li><strong>Don’t ask reviewers to review you at your place of business: </strong>If Google sees reviews coming from your business’ IP address, it may not treat them as legitimate. Ask customers to leave a review after they’re safely in their own homes, perhaps with a follow-up email.</li><li><strong>Don’t tell customers what to say:</strong> Don’t send customers a canned snippet of a suggested review to post. It’s important that their experience with your business shines through.</li><li><strong>Don’t review your own business: </strong>Google is smarter than that. Don’t review your own business or have anyone connected to your Google Business account leave a review on it.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Another great way to gain some extra exposure using your Google Business profile is to regularly use Google Posts, which you can learn more about on our blog about <a href="https://www.formandfunctionagency.com/how-to-use-google-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Use Google Posts to Boost Foot Traffic</a>.

									<p>In efforts to attract unbiased reviews, Yelp has a few more rules to keep an eye on than Google, so it’s important to understand the review platform’s policy to avoid having customer reviews taken down. Overall, Yelp gives preference to reviewers who have left reviews on their platform before, so asking a customer who doesn’t have an active Yelp account to leave a Yelp review might not be the most effective way to succeed on the platform. Instead, try to share the option to leave a Yelp review with customers who are already active Yelp users. In general, follow these policies from Yelp:</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t ask customers for Yelp Reviews: </strong>Instead, post Yelp paraphernalia around your website and place of business. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-04M9tynIgZ2cxXTMzc0POU75uRXXmB01REqpcN1mmshXWQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Request a sticker from the Yelp</a> and put it on your door or reception desk. <a href="https://www.yelpblog.com/2016/07/embed-feature-sharing-yelp-reviews-national-parks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post embedded Yelp Reviews</a> on your website. Avid Yelpers will take the hint and be more inclined to leave you a review that will contribute to your ranking on the platform.<br /><br /></li></ul><ul><li>Don’t ask your staff to compete to collect reviews. <br /><br /></li><li style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Don’t run surveys that ask for reviews from customers reporting positive experiences. <br /><br /></li><li style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Don’t ever offer freebies, discounts, or payment in exchange for reviews. </li></ul>								</div>

Consider posting about positive reviews on Facebook or posting a link to your review page to subtly encourage other customers to share their genuine experiences with your business as well.</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of how to stay on the right side of Facebook’s standards when asking for reviews:</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t review your business yourself</strong> or ask anyone connected to your page to do so.

If they’re not, you’re wading into murky territory with the social network’s integrity and authenticity guidelines. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reviews must focus on the product or service offered by the page. </strong>Reviews that don’t mention the business they reflect might be taken down. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reviews can’t include objectionable or illegal content. </strong></li></ul>								</div>

Most local businesses do an incredible job of delivering great services, but all it takes is one negative one to tarnish an online reputation. To avoid this, many savvy businesses are building review portals into their websites to direct positive reviewers to the most important reviews sites and provide themselves with one final chance to intervene and correct the bad experience of someone who might try to leave a negative review for their business. </p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of a review portal Form + Function built for one dental practice.
