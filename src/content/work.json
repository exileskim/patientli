    "title": "Forestville Family Dentistry: A Modern Brand + Website Helps a New Practice Gain Traction",
    "description": "<h4><strong>Client Overview:</strong></h4>\nForestville Family Dentistry operates in Forestville, CA, under a single practitioner. Following the acquisition from a retiring dentist, the owner aspired to introduce a revitalized brand and website, signaling a refreshing approach to dental care. The key goal was to mitigate potential patient loss during the transition and ensure new patient growth. Given the frequent patient migration to nearby towns for dental needs, it was crucial for the practice to be prominently visible in local online searches.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><strong>Challenges:</strong></h4>\n<strong>Generic Web Presence:</strong> The previous website used a standard template, with the practice lacking content ownership. The initial website was not unique, and its content was not proprietary, making it hard to differentiate the practice in the local digital landscape.\n\n<strong>Limited Mobile Usability:</strong> The website lacked responsiveness for mobile users. Potential patients accessing the website on mobile devices encountered a less than ideal user experience, making it harder to retain their interest.\n\n<strong>Absence of Distinct Branding:</strong> The practice did not have its own logo or recognizable brand identity. Without a distinct visual identity, it was challenging to differentiate the newly acquired practice from its predecessor or other competitors.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><strong>Solutions:</strong></h4>\n<strong>Branding Transformation:</strong> Form + Function created a distinctive brand for Forestville Family Dentistry, infusing a fresh color scheme, tailored fonts, and a renewed visual identity. With a fresh visual direction, the practice could now showcase its new management's approach and ethos.\n\n<strong>Custom Web Design:</strong> The new brand was integrated into a tailor-made website, adhering to healthcare website best practices. Each service and location was given its dedicated webpage, ensuring the site's seamless usability across varying devices and screen dimensions.\n\nAs the practice didn't previously own any of the content or images on its website, Form + Function designed and developed the website and all content for it, which the practice now owns. We purposefully used a simple website layout to avoid the need for lots of custom or stock photography, instead generating visual interest with the use of color and custom fonts.\n\n<strong>Comprehensive Digital Strategy:</strong> A robust online marketing approach was implemented, integrating SEO, targeted social media campaigns, and automated review solicitations. This strategy aimed at amplifying the practice's local online presence and driving a consistent inflow of new patients.\n<h4><strong>Results:</strong></h4>\n<strong>Prominent Online Visibility:</strong> Forestville Family Dentistry now stands out in local search outcomes, especially when potential patients seek dental services. Their revamped digital presence ensures that they are one of the first options potential patients encounter when seeking dental care in and around Forestville.\n\n<strong>Enhanced Patient Feedback:</strong> The practice now boasts a wealth of positive patient testimonials across various platforms. Such positive feedback not only adds credibility to the practice but also offers potential patients a glimpse into the quality of care they can expect.\n\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand.webp 1920w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand-300x169.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand-1024x576.webp 1024w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand-768x432.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand-1536x864.webp 1536w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Brand-600x338.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Homepage.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Homepage.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Homepage-300x225.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Homepage-768x576.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Homepage-600x450.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Service-Pages.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Service-Pages.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Service-Pages-300x225.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Service-Pages-768x576.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/Forestville-Service-Pages-600x450.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />",

    "description": "<h4><strong>Client Overview:</strong></h4>\nMonterey Peninsula Dental Group (MPDG) stands at the heart of downtown Monterey, California, delivering exceptional dental care since 1972. Comprising a dedicated team of dentists and hygienists, MPDG is committed to offering a high-quality dental experience in a serene ambiance. Their rich legacy, combined with state-of-the-art technologies, ensures comprehensive dental care services for the Monterey community.\n\nMPDG partnered with Form + Function to achieve a contemporary web presence to solidify its reputation as Monterey's premier dental practice. They aspired to augment their patient inflow and transition from a generic website to a tailor-made platform, highlighting the wide range of services they provide.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><strong>Challenges:</strong></h4>\n<strong>Generic, Poorly-Optimized Website:</strong> Prior to partnering with Form + Function, MPDG's website used a standard template developed by a large healthcare website provider. Aside from failing to do justice to their decades of service and wide range of offerings, MPDG's old website was poorly optimized for use on mobile devices and failed to include compelling content on each of the services the practice offered.\n\n<strong>Outdated Brand Image:</strong> Prior to Form + Function's rebrand, MPDG's logo and brand aesthetic didn't reflect the practice's modern capabilities and wide range of services. MPDG's visual representation felt stagnant and didn't encapsulate their advanced treatments and comprehensive services.\n\n<strong>Inconsistent New Patient Numbers:</strong> MPDG's web visibility wasn't pulling its weight for the practice, resulting in weak and inconsistent new patient numbers. Despite their decades-long legacy, they were overshadowed in online searches by newer competitors, limiting their ability to attract new patients.\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><strong>Solutions:</strong></h4>\n<strong>Branding Overhaul:</strong> Form + Function reimagined MPDG's brand, developing a refined color scheme, tailored fonts, and a revamped visual identity. MPDG’s new brand aesthetics, reflecting professionalism and modernity, aligned perfectly with their comprehensive offerings and dedication.\n\n<strong>Customized Website Design:</strong> We infused the refreshed brand across a custom website, underpinned by our focus on search marketing integrations and healthcare website best practices. Every service and specialty now has a dedicated page on a site designed for universal device compatibility, ensuring an optimal user experience.\n\n<strong>Holistic Digital Strategy: </strong>By intertwining SEO, paid search, and automated review requests, we elevated MPDG’s online presence, driving enhanced patient engagement.\n\n<strong>Results:</strong>\n\n<strong>MPDG Commands Top Search Rankings:</strong> MPDG's rejuvenated brand and website ensured top-tier search results, enhancing their local outreach. Their transformation catapulted them to the top of local searches, ensuring patients, new and existing, could easily find and access their services.\n\n<strong>1,600 + Positive Patient Reviews:</strong> A multitude of positive reviews across various platforms solidified MPDG's esteemed reputation. Our efforts in channeling patient feedback ensured that MPDG’s digital presence was filled with glowing testimonials, guiding potential patients with authentic experiences.\n\n<strong>Reliable New Patient Inflow:</strong> The digital revitalization translated to a steady influx of over 100 new patient interactions monthly. This consistent stream of patient inquiries, fueled by our strategies, enabled MPDG to augment their provider roster over time, further establishing their dominance in the Monterey area.\n\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-On-Device.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-On-Device.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-On-Device-300x186.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-On-Device-768x477.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-On-Device-600x373.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" />\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Homepage.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Homepage.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Homepage-300x225.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Homepage-768x576.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Homepage-600x450.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Service-Page.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Service-Page.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Service-Page-300x225.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Service-Page-768x576.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Service-Page-600x450.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />\n<img src=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Doctor-Profile.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"/marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Doctor-Profile.webp 1000w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Doctor-Profile-300x225.webp 300w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Doctor-Profile-768x576.webp 768w, /marketing/assets/uploads/2025/01/MPDG-Doctor-Profile-600x450.webp 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" />",
